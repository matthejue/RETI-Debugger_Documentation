\chapter{Motivation}
% mit dem Gedanken, dass Studenten das benutzen, daher Keybindings im Appendix sehr intuitiv

When I had to implement a PicoC-to-RETI-Compiler for my bachelor thesis I often had the problem that I had to debug the RETI code produced by the \alert{PicoC-Compiler}. \alert{PicoC} is a subset of C used in the operating systems lecture at the university of freiburg and \alert{RETI} is an assembler used in the operating systems and technical computer science lectures at the univeristy of freiburg. The PicoC-Compiler I implemented for the lecture has actually also a built-in \alert{RETI-Interpreter} that was neccessary to test the RETI-Code produced by the PicoC-Compiler. But just executing the RETI-Code and putting in print-Statements was not sufficient, I needed some kind of debugger. I came up with a provisional solution that can e.g. be seen \href{https://asciinema.org/a/526542}{here}. I implemented a sort of Vim plugin that was actually just a \href{https://github.com/matthejue/PicoC-Compiler/blob/master/src/interpr_showcase.vim}{config file} with special keybindings and settings. I implemented a special so called \alert{Show-Mode} into the PicoC-Compiler which actually just wrote the state of the RETI processor after each instruction with all it's registers, EPROM, UART and SRAM into a file and the provisional Vim plugin just jumped to the right place in this big file and used several windows that scrolled synchronously to fit as much RETI instructions as possible into the terminal window.

This solution was very proviosonal and it was the best low effort solution I could come up with in the short amount of time I had. The solution surely had it's flaws, because the whole program (codesegment) and datasegment hat to fit into the visible windows and one had to guess the number of windows neccessary beforehand. And if the program is too big there is a limit how for one can decrease the font size of the terminal window in order to fit as much RETI instructions as possible into the terminal window.

When I tutored the Operating Systems lecture using this \alert{Show-Mode} of the RETI-Interpreter to present the solutions of RETI exercises to the students I felt the urge to have a better tool for this, because for some programs I had to reduce the font size of the terminal window a lot such that the students could just barely see the instructions and values of the registers and memory cells.

And now for this missing semester course the choice for my project came quite naturally, I wanted to finally implement a proper \alert{RETI-Debugger} that communicates with the RETI-Interpreter to show the state of the RETI processor after each instruction with the not yet implemented possibility to change values in the RETI processor while it's executing the RETI program and doing other shenanigans like compiling the PicoC code within the buffer directly into RETI code etc.

In the following chapter \ref{chap:choosen_topics} two topics from the lecture that were used in the development of the plugin are going to be explained in more detail.

\chapter{Choosen Topics}
\label{chap:choosen_topics}

By the choice of my project the two main topics I had to choose were \alert{Neovim} and \alert{Python}, as the RETI-Debugger is going to be implemented as a \alert{Neovim plugin} and the RETI-Interpreter that is part of the PicoC-Compiler is implemented in Python. These two topics and other topics from the lecture also touched in the project are described in table \ref{tab:topics}.

\section{Installation and Testing}

% Recommended to just check out \inlinebox{Dockerfile}

As soon as the RETI-Debugger Neovim plugin and PicoC-Compiler including the RETI-Interpreter are installed, the different features of the plugin can be used with the help of the keybindings and commands discribed in the next section \ref{sec:keybindings and commands}.

\section{Keybindings and Commands}
\label{sec:keybindings and commands}

As soon as Neovim starts, if the configurations from the config file \inlinebox{custom\_init.lua} in the main folder of the RETI-Debugger repo is used in \inlinebox{\sim/.config/init.lua} then all of the commands in \ref{tab:commands} are going to be available by the call to the \inlinebox{setup} function as configured in the config file. The configuration in \inlinebox{custom\_init.lua} is also used by the \inlinebox{Dockerfile} that automatically sets up an image with the plugin to be directly installed and usable as soon as Neovim is started.

% internet connection

\newcommand{\loadretiexample}{Open a menu with a listing of example programs and open one with \inlinebox{Enter}}
\newcommand{\compilepicocbuffer}{Compile PicoC code in buffer to RETI}
\newcommand{\startretibuffer}{Start RETI code in the current buffer in the RETI-Debugger. Mounts the window layout, starts the RETI-Interpreter asynchronously and sets buffer and not yet set global keybindings keybindings}

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tblr}{
		width = \linewidth,
		colspec = {Q[1]Q[2]},
		row{1} = {PrimaryColor,fg=white},
		column{1} = {l},
		row{even} = {PrimaryColorDimmed},
		hlines = {PrimaryColor},
		vlines = {PrimaryColor},
		}
		Key                              & Effect                                            \\
		\inlinebox{:LoadRETIExample}     & \loadretiexample                                  \\
		\inlinebox{:LoadRETIExample num} & Load an example program by number \inlinebox{num} \\
		\inlinebox{:CompilePicoCBuffer}  & \compilepicocbuffer                               \\
		\inlinebox{:StartRETIBuffer}     & \startretibuffer
	\end{tblr}
  \caption{Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
\end{table}

All keybindings from \ref{tab:global keybindings} besides the keybinding \inlinebox{Space, then p, then h} to hide the layout are also directly available by the start of neovim, if they were passed to the \inlinebox{setup} function as it can be seen in the configuration in \inlinebox{custom\_init.lua}.

Because the students who get assigned to test this plugin probably don't know anything about PicoC or the RETI assembler I prepared the keybinding \inlinebox{Space, then p, then l} and the command \inlinebox{:LoadRETIExample}. The keybinding just calls the command without arguments. The keybinding and the command without arguments open a menu of different interesting PicoC programs that get loaded into the buffer by submitting them via \inlinebox{Enter} and can then be compiled with either \inlinebox{Space, then p, then c} or \inlinebox{:CompilePicoCBuffer}. After compiling the compiled RETI code in the buffer can be debugged in the RETI-Debugger via \inlinebox{Space, then p, then s} or \inlinebox{:StartRETIBuffer}.

  }

		\inlinebox{Space, then p, then s} & \startretibuffer          \\
		\inlinebox{Space, then p, then h} & Hide RETI-Debugger layout
	\end{tblr}
  \caption{Global Keybindings}
  \label{tab:global keybindings}
\end{table}

The menus all share the same keybindings that can be looked up in table \ref{tab:menu keybindings}.

\begin{table}[H]

	\begin{tblr}{

		colspec = {Q[1]Q[2]},

  }

    \inlinebox{j}, \inlinebox{$\downarrow$}, \inlinebox{Tab}, \inlinebox{m} & Focus next menu item \\
    \inlinebox{k}, \inlinebox{$\uparrow$}, \inlinebox{Shift + Tab}, \inlinebox{Shirt+m} & Focus previous menu item \\
    \inlinebox{Esc}, \inlinebox{q} & Close menu \\
    \inlinebox{Enter}, \inlinebox{Space} & Submit the select menu entry
	\end{tblr}
  \caption{Menu Keybindings}
  \label{tab:menu keybindings}
\end{table}

The error and output popup windows that appear for syntactically incorrect RETI code and output from the instruction \inlinebox{CALL PRINT <reg>} also have special keybindings that can be looked up in table \ref{tab:popup keybindings}.

\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tblr}{
		width = \linewidth,
		colspec = {Q[2]Q[3]},

  }

    \inlinebox{Enter}, \inlinebox{Esc}, \inlinebox{q}, clicking outside of the popup buffer & Close popup
	\end{tblr}
  \caption{Popup Keybindings}
  \label{tab:popup keybindings}
\end{table}

The input window that appear for input requests from the instruction \inlinebox{CALL INPUT <reg>} also has special keybindings that can be looked up in table \ref{tab:input field keybindings}.

\begin{table}[H]

	\begin{tblr}{

		vlines = {PrimaryColor},
  }
		Key                    & Effect                    \\
		\inlinebox{Enter} & Submit input typed into the input field
	\end{tblr}
  \caption{Input field keybindings}
  \label{tab:input field keybindings}
\end{table}

As soon as the window layout is mounted within the buffers of this layout the keybindings in table \ref{tab:buffer keybindings} can be used. The buffers of this window layout have their own keybindings and overwrite the vim default and all other keybindinds and only work within the buffers and not outside of the buffers.

\begin{table}[H]
